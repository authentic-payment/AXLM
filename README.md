AXLM is a 1 : 1 backed xlm token.

for every AXLM token one XLM is going to be stored in the order book and liquidity pool. 

AXLM is also one of our tokens that will be used on other blockchains as a form of bridge.

Move your lumens over to another blockchain and hold them in your favourite wallet while being able to send them back and claim your xlm back. 

We reward all AXLM holders with $Apay on a quarterly base.

Authentic-Payment is allowed to take a 5% cut and openly use it for development, marketing or liquidity every half year
